## 📊 Retail Sales Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing retail sales data using SQL to uncover meaningful business insights.  
It demonstrates a complete data analysis workflow starting from database setup and data cleaning,  
to exploratory data analysis (EDA) and answering real-world business questions.

The analysis helps in understanding customer behavior, sales performance across different product  
categories, and identifying high value customers and peak sales periods. Key insights include  
sales trends over time, category performance, customer demographics, and transaction patterns  
based on time shifts (morning, afternoon, and evening).

The project showcases practical SQL skills such as data aggregation, filtering, grouping,  
and analytical thinking to support data driven business decision making.
