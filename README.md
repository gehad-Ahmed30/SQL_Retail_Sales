## 📊 Retail Sales Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing retail sales data using SQL to uncover meaningful business insights.  
It demonstrates the complete data analysis workflow, starting from database setup and data cleaning,  
to exploratory data analysis (EDA) and answering real-world business questions.

The analysis helps in understanding customer behavior, sales performance across different product  
categories, and identifying high-value customers and peak sales periods. Key insights include  
sales trends over time, category performance, customer demographics, and transaction patterns  
based on time shifts (morning, afternoon, and evening).

This project is designed for beginners and showcases practical SQL skills that are essential for  
data analyst roles, such as data aggregation, filtering, grouping, and analytical thinking to  
support business decision-making.
